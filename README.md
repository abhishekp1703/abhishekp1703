 Abhishek Patil 👋

Software Engineer, currently pursuing a Master’s degree at Texas A&M University 

I specialize in scaling Agentic AI from research prototypes to production-grade distributed systems. With 3+ years of experience at Veritas (Cohesity), I have a proven track record of architecting high-availability backends and enterprise data protection platforms.

My current academic focus at Texas A&M involves intersection of Distributed Systems and AI. I am particularly interested in optimising LLM inference, Agentic RAG orchestration, and real-time context injection for autonomous workflows.
